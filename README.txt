Comp465: Project 1 README

Project Member Names: Ernie Ledezma, Stanislav Kirdey

Instructions:  Open up the .sln project and execute the .cpp file!

Summary:  
Overall everything for Phase 1 was accomplished.  We based our project on the ManyModelsStatic and ManyCubes examples.  We decided to use Shape3D.hpp class from the ManyCubes static since we found that loading models though it was much more efficient.  
Using classes and objects helps to make our project more modular and therefore easier to edit for future phases. And there was rotation logic available in the Shape3D that helped us with our orbital rotations.
	As our project stands we have loaded 7 models, 5 of which are all spheres and the other is the custom models for  “Warbird” and missile.  The moons and planets seem to be orbiting correctly and are at the right spot.  For our missile model we used a ‘missile.tri” shape and for the warbird we have “battleship.tri”. Both were done in AC3D.	
Each View is controlled by pressing “v”.  At first the project is loaded in an initial view.  When the user hits v for the first time he enter the “toggle loop” which starts out with “Front View”.  So it might seem like hitting “v” did nothing the first time, but it did. I t simply switched from default view, to the first view on the toggle loop, which is “Front View”.
